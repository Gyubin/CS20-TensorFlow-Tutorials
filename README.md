# CS20-TensorFlow-Tutorials

This repository contains code examples for the course CS 20: TensorFlow for Deep Learning Research.

Detailed syllabus and lecture notes can be found [here](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs20si/).

For this course, I use python3.5, TensorFlow 1.6 and [official codes](https://github.com/chiphuyen/stanford-tensorflow-tutorials) of [chiphuyen](https://github.com/chiphuyen).
